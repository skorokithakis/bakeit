BakeIt
------

BakeIt is a command line utility (and Python library) to
`Pastery <https://www.pastery.net>`__, the best pastebin in the world.
BakeIt aims to be simple to use and unobtrusive.

Installation
============

To install from PyPI, use ``pip``:

::

    pip install bakeit

For development, clone the repository and use ``uv``:

::

    git clone https://github.com/skorokithakis/bakeit.git
    cd bakeit
    uv sync
    uv run bakeit

You are done!

Usage
=====

Using BakeIt is similarly easy. First, create a file with your Pastery
API key in ``~/.config/bakeit.cfg``, like so:

::

    [pastery]
    api_key = eisha8ahqui7Aesh0fasyu8HFsdo

Then, just pass the file you want to upload to the ``bakeit`` command:

::

    $ bakeit myfile.txt
    Paste URL: https://www.pastery.net/oniasd/

You can also pipe stuff to it:

::

    $ cat myfile.txt | grep hello | bakeit
    Paste URL: https://www.pastery.net/oxczvs/


The config file
===============

A full config file can look like this:

::

    [pastery]
    api_key = eisha8ahqui7Aesh0fasyu8HFsdo
    duration = 2880

The ``api_key`` parameter, as explained above, is mandatory. You can find it at
the bottom of `your Pastery account page <https://www.pastery.net/account/>`__.

The ``duration`` parameter is optional. If set, it will be used as the default
duration for every new paste. The command-line argument takes precedence over
this parameter, though, so you can change it per-paste when invoking ``bakeit``.


Usage as a Python library
=========================

BakeIt provides the ``PasteryUploader`` class:

::

    >>> from bakeit import PasteryUploader
    >>> pu = PasteryUploader("your API key")
    >>> pu.upload("this is the text to upload")
    "https://www.pastery.net/pabtus/"

``PasteryUploader`` accepts the following arguments:

-  ``body`` - The body of the paste.
-  ``title`` (optional) - The title to give the paste.
-  ``language`` (optional) - The language the paste is in. Pastery will
   attempt to autodetect this if omitted.
-  ``duration`` (optional) - The number of minutes to keep this paste
   for.
-  ``max_views`` (optional) - The number of views to keep this paste
   for.

Happy pasting!
